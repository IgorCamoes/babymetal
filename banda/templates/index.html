        In March 2014, they took the stage at Nippon Budokan for a 2-day gig, making them the youngest female act to perform there. Their 1st studio album BABYMETAL instantly made it to the US Billboard charts. In summer of the same year, they embarked on their first world tour, performing on the main stage at UK’s prodigious festival Sonisphere Festival 2014 in front of 65,000 festival goers and supporting Lady Gaga on her ArtRave: The Artpop Ball 2014 Tour.

        In summer of 2015, BABYMETAL received various awards from prominent UK music magazines KERRANG! and METAL HAMMER and became the first Japanese artist to ever receive these awards. BABYMETAL also performed on the main stage at the massive Reading & Leeds. In April 2016, BABYMETAL had a simultaneous global release for their 2nd album METAL RESISTANCE. Not only did they make the charts in Japan, they also became the highest-charting Japanese band ever on UK’s Official Albums Chart, landing at no. 15th. They also reached the 39th spot on its debut on the U.S. Billboard, becoming the first album by a Japanese artist to break into the chart’s top 40 in more than 53 years. During that same month, BABYMETAL performed at the prestigious Wembley Arena in the UK, becoming the first Japanese artist to ever headline at the venue. They completed their world tour in September at the Tokyo Dome for a consecutive 2 days with over 110,000 people to witness the massive tour final. Not only have they achieved all of the above, they have performed as special guests in various international locations for the RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, METALLICA, GUNS N’ ROSES, and KORN. BABYMETAL’s challenge for world domination continues and only the Fox God knows what the future will hold.
